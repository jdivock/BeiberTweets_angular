BeiberTweets_angular
====================

Had too much trouble writing this thing in meteor, just redoing it in node/angular

TODO: 
- [] Set up a way to refresh twitter connection. 
- [] Only stream from twitter when socketio connection > 0


Note to self: 
* git aws.push to deploy
* eb restart to bounce server
